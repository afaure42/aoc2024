# My Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

https://adventofcode.com/2024

Advent of Code is an Advent calender of small programming puzzles.
They are always composed of 2 parts, you cannot know the second part until you have solved the first one. ( reusable code is paramount ! ).

This year i'm using AOC to learn Rust ! So i wont participate in the 42 Paris speed leaderboard, my challenge is to try to use a new feature of rust everyday !
